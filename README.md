We haven't found very many fresh ransomware malware samples available on github, so we decided to put one together.

Our goal is to help researchers and malware analysts who are looking for examples of Ransomware Malware and other kinds of virus samples for analysis, research, reverse engineering, sandboxing, and review.  

We may be adding additional files to this repository from time to time.

This should go without saying, but Please be sure to exercise ===EXTREME CAUTION=== when handling these files because as you well know, they have been designed and developed with malicious intent by their original authors.  We believe in transparency and helping the good guys have the right access and tools they need to rip these malicious files apart.

**We welcome all requests and contributions!**

**Please remember that these are live and dangerous malware! Do NOT run them unless you are absolutely sure of what you are doing! They are to be used only for educational purposes only. !!!**

We highly recommend reviewing these files in a pristine sandboxed environment or in a dedicated Virtual Machine that has no Internet access.  If you are not careful, you **will infect yourself or others with dangerous malware!!!**
